  ## Installation

  To use this program you can fork the program, download it, and open it in your code editor of choice. Run npm start to launch the program, which can then be tested in conjunction with insomnia or a similar routes program. 

  ## Usage

  Using insomnia (or a similar program) you can create and manage routes via selecting the appropriate route and url at the top of the screen. In cases where a user wishes to alter existing information they will need to insert those changes under the JSON tab and edit the info they would like changed accordingly under that section.
